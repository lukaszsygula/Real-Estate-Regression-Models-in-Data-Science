# Real-Estate-Regression-Models-in-Data-Science

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate various regression models for predicting real estate prices. The project applies several techniques, including:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

### Key Phases of the Project:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Loading and cleaning real estate data.
   - Preparing the data for analysis.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Implementing different regression models.
   - Evaluating model performance using MSE (Mean Squared Error) and R^2 metrics.

3. **Optimization and Tuning:**
   - Tuning hyperparameters of the models.
   - Performing cross-validation for better model generalization.

4. **Results Presentation:**
   - Visualizing the results and comparing models.
   - Reporting key findings and recommendations.

## Data

The project uses data on real estate prices in King County, WA. The dataset includes information on property features and sale prices.

## Results Presentation
